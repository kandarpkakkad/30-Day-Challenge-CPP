	// The basic idea behind KMPâ€™s algorithm is: whenever we detect a mismatch (after some matches), we already know some of the characters in the text of the next window.
	// We compare first window of txt with pat
	// txt = "AAAAABAAABA"
	// pat = "AAAA"  [Initial position]
	// We find a match. This is same as Naive String Matching.
	// In the next step, we compare next window of txt with pat.
	// txt = "AAAAABAAABA"
	// pat =  "AAAA" [Pattern shifted one position]
	// This is where KMP does optimization over Naive. In this
	// second window, we only compare fourth A of pattern
	// with fourth character of current window of text to decide
	// whether current window matches or not. Since we know
	// first three characters will anyway match, we skipped
	// matching first three characters.
	// Need of Preprocessing?
	// An important question arises from the above explanation,
	// how to know how many characters to be skipped. To know this,
	// we pre-process pattern and prepare an integer array
	// lps[] that tells us the count of characters to be skipped.
	// lps means Longest Proper Prefix which is also suffix.
	// We search for lps in sub-patterns. More clearly we focus on sub-strings of patterns that are either prefix and suffix.
	// For each sub-pattern pat[0..i] where i = 0 to m-1, lps[i] stores length of the maximum matching proper prefix which is also a suffix of the sub-pattern pat[0..i].
	// We use a value from lps[] to decide the next characters to be matched. The idea is to not match a character that we know will anyway match.
	// Time Complexity: O(max(n, m))
	// Space Complexity: O(m)
